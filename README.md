# ML-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-Project
## Loan Repayment Prediction Project

In this project, I employ Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms to predict the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan. The primary objective of this project is to compare the predictive accuracy of both Decision Trees and Random Forest in this context.

## Key Insights

- **Algorithm Comparison:** We explore and compare the performance of Decision Trees and Random Forest. It's fascinating to observe that while Random Forest generally exhibits superior performance, Decision Trees can outshine it in specific feature scenarios.

- **Feature Optimization:** This project underscores the importance of domain knowledge in determining which features to prioritize for optimization. Making informed decisions about feature selection is crucial for selecting the best algorithm for the task.

This is a project for the Data Science and Machine Learning with Python course.
